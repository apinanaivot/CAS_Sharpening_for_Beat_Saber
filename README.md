# CAS Sharpening Reshade for Beat Saber

AMD's new Contrast Adaptive Sharpening technology makes Beat Saber look super sharp and clear even on older headsets, such as the Rift CV1 and HTC Vive, and even clearer on newer headsets. It works on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.

This ReShade preset is based on The Sharper Eye preset for SkyrimVR by Fholger, but it has been specifically tailored for Beat Saber.

###Installation
- Unzip the contents to the same directory where your Beat Saber.exe is (such as C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber) 

- You can adjust the reshade settings (such as sharpening strength) in-game, by pressing the "home" key. You'll have to take off your headset while adjusting them.
